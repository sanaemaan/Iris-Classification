# Iris Flower Classification — CodeAlpha Task 1

This project trains a simple machine learning model to classify Iris flower species using 4 measurements.

## How to run (Google Colab — easiest)
1. Open https://colab.research.google.com
2. Click **File > Upload notebook** and upload `Iris_Classification.ipynb`.
3. Run cells from top to bottom (press **Shift+Enter**).
4. The notebook will show accuracy, a confusion matrix, and an example prediction.
5. The trained model will be saved as `iris_model.pkl` (download from the side panel in Colab).

## How to run locally (your own laptop)
1. Install Python 3.10+ from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open a terminal and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `Iris_Classification.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Deliverables
- Notebook with outputs (`Iris_Classification.ipynb`)
- Saved model (`iris_model.pkl`)
- GitHub repo (suggested name: `CodeAlpha_IrisClassification`)
- Short LinkedIn post (tag `@CodeAlpha`) with your repo link
